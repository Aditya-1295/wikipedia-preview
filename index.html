      <h2>Excerpt from the Cat article</h2>
      <p>
        The <span data-wikipedia-preview data-wp-title="Chat" data-wp-lang="fr">cat</span> (Felis catus) is a small <span data-wikipedia-preview>carnivorous</span> mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the <span data-wikipedia-preview>family</span>. The cat is either a house cat or a farm cat, which are pets, or a feral cat, which ranges freely and avoids human contact. A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and <span data-wikipedia-preview>for (not an article)</span> its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
